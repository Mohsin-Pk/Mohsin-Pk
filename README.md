### Python Developer | Web Scraping Specialist | Automation Enthusiast | Freelancer

I'm a self-taught developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in Python development and web scraping. I specialize in building robust automation tools and scalable scraping solutions to extract, clean, and structure data from the web.

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve worked on several personal and freelance projects involving real-time data collection, automation pipelines, and data processing using Python. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and love optimizing scripts for performance and accuracy.

Currently open to freelance and remote opportunities â€” especially those involving web automation, scraping bots, or backend scripting. My focus is on solving real-world problems using code that just works.
